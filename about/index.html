        <p class="about__description margin-topbtm-7">
          A builder at heart, I am madly in love with hackathons and technical meet-ups. It is one of the many events where I wrap myself around bubbles of ideas, haikus of code and like minded superheroes to build software applications to solve interesting problems.

        <p class="about__head">Passionate about edtech</p>


        <p class="about__description margin-topbtm-7">
          At night, I dream of building many intuitive educational tools combined with the capabilities of data science to empower people in their learning experiences so that they may expand their minds for the benefit of innovation.
