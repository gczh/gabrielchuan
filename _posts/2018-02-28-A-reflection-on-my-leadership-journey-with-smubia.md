## Starting Out

- hard af


## On Execution

- literally jumped into fire despite a mentor's advice to focus on myself
- could have been more focused using aids like KPIs

## On Communicating

- Sandwich method

## On Apologies

- Sorry for falling short of expectations
- Sorry for not always following through with advice; It was hard. I had to make my own judgement calls and in no way this meant the advice wasn't good.

## On Gratitude

- Thankful for a wonderful team
- Thankful for mentors and guidance from many industry practitioners along the way
- Kai Xin for inspiring me through his journey with building DataScienceSG
- DataScienceSG committee members for the various advice you dished out as I begun and traversed this path.
- Tan Hu-shien for inspiring me on how to build a student community through (SEED SIG)[https://www.sp.edu.sg/wps/portal/vp-spws/schdmit.news?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/lib-dmit/internet/news/20130619-s.e.e.d+sig+student+techno-journey+in+hackathons]
- Pui Kwan for the first lunch meet with me and Long. It really helped us to clarify our thinking.
- Hui Jian for being there to clarify my thought processes. For being the "neutral observer" that provides perspective I wouldn't have had otherwise under normal circumstances. These perspectives allowed me to introspect on much deeper levels and subsequently make leaps in improving myself in many ways.
- Roy lee for being the warrior that has gone through wars before and used his experiences to help guide me very effectively.
- Jae Lee for teaching me the sandwich method.
- Nushackers for inspiring me with their open source credo. That's why I made (smubia.org)[https://smubia.org] open source!
- SEED SIG for being the support community that invigorates me with energy as I watch each member's passion light up my life. Your successes energize me.
- SMU Real Business for helping me start out on my first journey into CCAs in SMU. ASVF was awesome and I learnt loads about myself and the pros from other countries
- The previous exco and their friends for giving me this opportunity. Thanks Ranon, Akshita and Vincent. I have no idea what you saw in me, but I am thankful you gave me an opportunity to use what fire I had in me to light up this world.
- SMU mods like LTB that really helped me to refine my thinking processes about teamwork
- My friends for being understanding and patient with me
