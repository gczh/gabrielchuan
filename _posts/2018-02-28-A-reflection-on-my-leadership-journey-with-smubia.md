## On People



## On Management

## On Setbacks

- hard af


## On Execution

- literally jumped into fire despite a mentor's advice to focus on myself
- could have been more focused using aids like KPIs

## On Communicating

- Sandwich method
- Remember that we are all emotional people, to some extent. We can't deny this. Consequently, think twice before saying something. Think it through again. When I'm finally convinced, it should be packaged properly. Then deliver it with an "emotional punch"

## On Apologies

- Sorry for falling short of expectations
- Sorry for not always following through with advice; It was hard. I had to make my own judgement calls and in no way this meant the advice wasn't good.

## On Gratitude

- Thankful for a wonderful team
- Thankful for mentors and guidance from many industry practitioners along the way
- Kai Xin for inspiring me through his journey with building DataScienceSG
- DataScienceSG committee members for the various advice you dished out as I begun and traversed this path.
- Tan Hu-shien for inspiring me on how to build a student community through (SEED SIG)[https://www.sp.edu.sg/wps/portal/vp-spws/schdmit.news?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/lib-dmit/internet/news/20130619-s.e.e.d+sig+student+techno-journey+in+hackathons]
- Pui Kwan for the first lunch meet with me and Long. It really helped us to clarify our thinking.
- Hui Jian for being there to clarify my thought processes. For being the "neutral observer" that provides perspective I wouldn't have had otherwise under normal circumstances. These perspectives allowed me to introspect on much deeper levels and subsequently make leaps in improving myself in many ways.
- Roy lee for being the warrior that has gone through wars before and used his experiences to help guide me very effectively.
- Jae Lee for teaching me the sandwich method.
- Nushackers for inspiring me with their open source credo. That's why I made (smubia.org)[https://smubia.org] open source!
- SEED SIG for being the support community that invigorates me with energy as I watch each member's passion light up my life. Your successes energize me.
- SMU Real Business for helping me start out on my first journey into CCAs in SMU. ASVF was awesome and I learnt loads about myself and the pros from other countries
- The previous exco and their friends for giving me this opportunity. Thanks Ranon, Akshita and Vincent. I have no idea what you saw in me, but I am thankful you gave me an opportunity to use what fire I had in me to light up this world.
- SMU mods like LTB that really helped me to refine my thinking processes about teamwork
- My friends for being understanding and patient with me
