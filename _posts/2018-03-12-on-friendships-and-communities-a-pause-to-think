It was my observation of friendships that as we progress through life, different circumstances and experiences alter our growth trajectories, for better or worser. Despite all of that, my belief was that friendships could still remain strong as long as camaraderie was built. Mostly through toughing it out together. We remember experiences and emotions in these experiences better than vague, day-to-day things we do with friends. We also remember reciprocity, when you try new ways to approach things and share them with friends (or at least who you think they are) and they reciprocate in their own ways.

I have always believed that I could be friends with just about anyone. Everyone has an interesting story to share, if only we bothered to approach them and peered within. These are what gave me the relatively wide perspective I have when looking at things. It also gives me tolerance for a wider variety of things - things that people might find quirky, weird or bizarre (yeah well, a majority of people prefer consistency in their lives. Such that when something doesn't fit within their beliefs, it irritates them if they can't reconcile it with their set of beliefs)

However, more recently, I am resigned to think that perhaps evolutionary psychology (or basic in-built biological constraints for that matter) would prevail over most of my attempts to construct such relationships. How do I mean? Robin Dubar proposed in 1990s that "humans can comfortably maintain only 150 stable relationships", largely due to the biological limits of our memory.
