# A Year Of Data Science: Day 01

## What is it?

It's an attempt for an aspiring data scientist to try and learn as much as he can before graduating from university. My goal isn't to master data science entirely. It's to come up with a feasible system that consistently puts in effort to improve myself as much as I can towards the end goal: getting better at data science.

## Inspiration

I have been pursuing different things the past 3 years of my university education. I have failed various things, succeeded at some things. But what were they all for? I met a special someone that became an inspiration to my life and regained focus on what's important. I still am relatively unfocused but A Year of Data Science is going to be a genuine, full-hearted attempt at being consistent at something. I hope this would serve as an inspiration for many. I hope this counts as producing more than what I consume.

## Day 01's Progress

I was inspired and encouraged by [Kai Xin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thiakx/?originalSubdomain=sg) from DataScienceSG to practice leetcode over a year and try to complete all it's problems. A tall order, but I think... if I could consistently hammer away at this, I could probably finish a substantial amount of practice.

Here's today's attempt:

**Data Structures & Algorithms**

1. [9. Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)
2. [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
3. [346. Moving Average From Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/moving-average-from-data-stream/)

They are easy problems but they count towards starting with the lowest hanging fruit, towards building incremental habits (something like, or pretty much [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits))

**Machine Learning**

I'm currently working on a school assignment for a module, Intro to Machine Learning which covers the following concepts in at quite some depth:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Lasso Regression
4. Ridge Regression
5. Regularization Functions
6. Contour Plots

We will see if I can fork some time out another day to write up on exactly what I have learnt(:
