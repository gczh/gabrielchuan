A door is a frame; a frame that allows you to step into a new environment, bounded by constructs such as man-made walls or demarcators. Within these boundaries, we look at spaces in different ways. Homes, cafes, offices, you name it. We associate each of these spaces with a particular set of emotions and behaviors. An office is a place for work, where we are supposed to be productive. Or at least that's how we framed what an office should be like.

On frames, **perspectives shape how we frame things.** It changes the way we associate behaviors and emotions with anything we feel belonging to that frame. If we frame something as possible, we tend to associate the set of behaviors and emotions that are positive such that possibilities are made possible. There is always some truth in old adages. Recall how you were told about looking at a glass if it is half empty or full, and that being aware of such frames would empower us to make more informed decisions.
